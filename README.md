Technologies used.

- Slick for carousel
- HTML/CSS Validators
- Sublime


Your process/approach.
- I started with a few wireframing drafts on both a whiteboard and in a notebook, along with a few notes about organization and content of pages
- Created a priority list of what should be updated first when it came to extras (links, effects, etc), along with a "to-do" for each day we had to work on the project. At the beginning of each day I reassessed what still needed to be done.
- Started with the homepage HTML and CSS. Once those were complete, I moved onto creating additional pages.
- For JS/jQuery, researched techniques, looking for the best solutions that fit our level of knowledge with the language.
- Worked in the lounge after class each day with some of my cohort, helping each other problem solve when we were all stuck on the same problem. Great minds think alike, and also miss semi-colons occasionally.

- Ended with Media Queries, once all CSS for desktop was final.


Unsolved problems.
- Making my Google Map responsive. I hid it in mobile, especially because the scrolling can be tricky, but would have liked to fix it in tablet view.
- Would like to create a Location page with a larger map and information about local hotels, etc.
- Slick edits : not an unsolved problem, but I would have liked to adjust some more of the CSS on my carousel. Make it not as tall, make the circles different. Things like that.

Your biggest wins and challenges.
- Figuring out how to enlarge the photos on my gallery page. TA Julie guided me in the right direction when I had almost given up (after trying different techniques for modals and lightboxes), and it was the best victory when I got it to work, and look just how I wanted it to. Now that it's complete, it seems like such a simple effect on the page, but I know how much time went into getting it just right.
- Learning to always keep the Console open in browser and check regularly for errors/things I may have missed.
