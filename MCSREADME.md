-Biggest Challenges:
	-THE CAROUSEL!

		-This was a new technology. I found it challenging to implement a plug-in library for the first time. At first I didn't know how to implement the library in my code.
		- It looks like i had a few too many <script> tags in the header and a lot of my css styling was interfering with the carousel. 
		-I ended up wrapping <h3><img></h3> and removed the text to simplify things. 
		-I also discovered that the hidden class was interfering with the display on the web page. 
		-I ended up wrapping all the contents in another <div class="hidden"> and that seemed to remedy the issue. 
		-The initial page of the carousel was a lot smaller than the rest of the carousel. 
		-At first I thought it was due to my images being different sizes. When I isolated the image and replaced it with same sized image the problem was still there. 
		-That led me to think it was something else.  
		-I ended up putting text in the box (with jade's help) figured out that the very first slide acts like a filler slide. 
		-I decided to use that as a 'title' page to introduce images. 
		-At first the text seemed really off. one single word to the right of page. 
		-with some careful thought behind the design and message I wanted to convey I designed the page in  way that would modify the size of initial page to be the same size as the photos. 
		-I tried to solve the original issue from a design perspective. 
		-Best way to go about it? who knows. but it works! -->
